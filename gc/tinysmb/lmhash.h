 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *  This module implements the LM hash.  The NT hash is simply the MD4() of
 *  the password, so we don't need a separate implementation of that.  This
 *  module also implements the LM response, which can be combined with the
 *  NT hash to produce the NTLM response.
 *
 *  This implementation was created based on the description in my own book.
 *  The book description was, in turn, written after studying many existing
 *  examples in various documentation.  Jeremy Allison and Andrew Tridgell
 *  deserve lots of credit for having figured out the secrets of Lan Manager
 *  authentication many years ago.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- **
 * Functions:
 */

uchar *auth_LMhash( uchar *dst, const uchar *pwd, const int pwdlen );
  /* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **
   * Generate an LM Hash from the input password.
   *
   *  Input:  dst     - Pointer to a location to which to write the LM Hash.
   *                    Requires 16 bytes minimum.
   *          pwd     - Source password.  Should be in OEM charset (extended
   *                    ASCII) format in all upper-case, but this
   *                    implementation doesn't really care.  See the notes
   *                    below.
   *          pwdlen  - Length, in bytes, of the password.  Normally, this
   *                    will be strlen( pwd ).
   *
   *  Output: Pointer to the resulting LM hash (same as <dst>).
   *
   *  Notes:  This function does not convert the input password to upper
   *          case.  The upper-case conversion should be done before the
   *          password gets this far.  DOS codepage handling and such
   *          should be taken into consideration.  Rather than attempt to
   *          work out all those details here, the function assumes that
   *          the password is in the correct form before it reaches this
   *          point.
   *
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **
   */


uchar *auth_LMresponse( uchar *dst, const uchar *hash, const uchar *challenge );
  /* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **
   * Generate the LM (or NTLM) response from the password hash and challenge.
   *
   *  Input:  dst       - Pointer to memory into which to write the response.
   *                      Must have 24 bytes available.
   *          hash      - Pointer to the 16-byte password hash.
   *          challenge - Pointer to the 8-byte challenge.
   *
   *  Output: A pointer to the 24-byte response (same as <dst>).
   *
   *  Notes:  The function does not check the lengths of the input or output
   *          parameters.  The byte sizes given above must be respected by
   *          calling function.
